    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      I'm Tudor — a software QA automation engineer based in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.
      By day I break things on purpose so they don't break in production.
      By night I obsess over fuel consumption logs, dividend yields, and home office ergonomics.

    <h2>What this blog is</h2>
    <p>
      A place for writing I'd actually want to read. Three topics, no fillers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>QA & Automation</strong> — real scripts, real tools, real war stories from test engineering.</li>
      <li><strong>Automotive</strong> — long-term ownership data, not press-fleet impressions. Real numbers from real driving.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Finance</strong> — building a portfolio from Romania, documented in public. DCA, dividends, and avoiding stupid decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The gear</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily driver: Kia Sportage GT-Line 2.0 CRDi 185 hp AWD AT6</li>
      <li>Machine: MacBook Pro</li>
      <li>Tools: Playwright, Copilot, too much coffee</li>
    </ul>
