## Welcome

This is the first article on this blog. Expect honest, data-driven content across three areas:

- **QA & Automation** — real scripts, real tools, real problems solved.
- **Automotive** — actual fuel consumption numbers, ownership costs, and long-term reviews.
- **Personal Finance** — building a portfolio from Romania, in public.

No fluff. Just signal.
