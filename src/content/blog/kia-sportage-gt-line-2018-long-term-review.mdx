## The Car at a Glance

Before anything else, here is exactly what this article covers:

| Spec | Detail |
|---|---|
| Model | Kia Sportage IV (QL facelift) |
| Model year | 2018 |
| Market | European specification |
| Engine | 2.0 CRDi — R-series diesel, 1,995 cc |
| Output | 185 hp (136 kW) @ 4,000 rpm |
| Torque | 400 Nm @ 1,750–2,750 rpm |
| Transmission | 6-speed torque-converter automatic (AT6) |
| Drivetrain | AWD (HTRAC — on-demand rear axle) |
| Trim | GT-Line |
| Kerb weight | ~1,730 kg |
| 0–100 km/h | 8.5 s (official) |
| WLTP combined | 6.1 L/100 km (official) |

This is not the 136 hp front-wheel-drive version you see on most used car listings. The 185 hp variant with the torque-converter automatic and HTRAC all-wheel drive was the flagship powertrain for the QL generation in Europe — and it behaves differently enough that it deserves its own treatment.

## Why This Engine and Gearbox Combination Matters

The Sportage QL was sold with several diesel options depending on market. In Europe the 2.0 CRDi came in two states of tune: 136 hp (FWD only, manual or DCT) and 185 hp. The 185 hp version is exclusively paired with a conventional 6-speed torque-converter automatic — not the 7-speed dual-clutch that Kia used elsewhere — and with the HTRAC AWD system.

That torque-converter detail is significant. It is hydraulically smoother than the DCT, holds up better in stop-start city traffic, and does not suffer the low-speed shudder that plagued some DCT-equipped Korean cars of the same era. If you drive in a city with real winters and real traffic, you want the AT6 over the DCT.

The HTRAC system distributes torque between axles electronically. In normal conditions it runs primarily front-wheel drive to save fuel. Under acceleration, load, or detected wheel slip, it can send up to 50 percent of torque rearward. It is not a rock-crawler system — it is a confidence-in-bad-weather system, and at that job it is very good.

## The GT-Line Trim: What You Actually Get

GT-Line is a styling package, not a performance upgrade. Power output is identical to the cheaper Platinum trim that also used the 185 hp engine. What you gain:

**Exterior:**
- Sportier front bumper with larger air intakes
- Red GT-Line badging
- Gloss black grille surround and mirror caps
- 19-inch alloy wheels (larger than the 17" on lower trims)
- Dual exhaust finishers (purely cosmetic — single pipe underneath)

**Interior:**
- Partial leather / suede (Dinamica) sport seats with contrasting stitching
- Flat-bottomed steering wheel
- Red ambient lighting accents
- GT-Line floor mats

**Important caveat on the 19" wheels:** They look good. They also increase rolling resistance, transmit more road noise into the cabin, and contribute to higher real-world fuel consumption versus the 17" tyres on lesser trims. This is not Kia's fault — it is physics.

## Fuel Consumption: The Honest Numbers

This is where most car reviews fail. They quote WLTP and move on. Here are real-world figures across different driving contexts, accumulated over years of ownership.

### City driving (Cluj-Napoca, mixed urban)
- Summer: **9.5–11.0 L/100 km**
- Winter (below -5°C, cold starts, idling, heated seats + steering wheel): **12.0–14.5 L/100 km**

The winter penalty is severe and comes from multiple compounding factors: diesel needs to reach operating temperature before it runs efficiently, the torque converter has higher hydraulic drag when cold, the AWD system engages the rear axle more frequently on slippery surfaces, and all the electrical ancillaries (heating, defrost, blower) add load.

### Mixed driving (city + motorway, ~50/50)
- **7.5–8.5 L/100 km** year-round

### Motorway (130 km/h cruise, flat road, no headwind)
- **6.0–6.8 L/100 km**

### Best ever recorded (relaxed rural roads, 80–90 km/h, summer)
- **5.3 L/100 km**

The WLTP figure of 6.1 L/100 km is achievable — but only on a gentle motorway run with no HVAC load and a tailwind. In the real world the Sportage is a **9–10 L/100 km city car** in Romanian conditions. Plan accordingly.

## The Engine in Use

The R-series 2.0 CRDi is a known, mature diesel unit. It has been in production in various forms since the mid-2000s. By 2018 it was well-sorted. A few observations from extended real-world use:

**Torque delivery:** 400 Nm from 1,750 rpm is immediately noticeable. In city traffic the car feels effortlessly quick from low revs. You rarely need to rev past 3,000 rpm in daily driving.

**Motorway overtaking:** With the AT6 in Sport mode (or a manual kickdown), the gearbox drops two ratios and the car surges to 160+ km/h with authority. It does not feel like a 1,730 kg SUV in that moment.

**Cold start noise:** Diesel rattle is present and audible on cold starts below 5°C. It disappears within 60–90 seconds of driving. This is normal for the engine and not a fault indicator, but it surprises passengers unfamiliar with diesel.

**DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter):** This is the single most important thing to understand about this engine in 2026. The DPF requires regular regeneration cycles — passive (on motorway runs) or active (triggered by the ECU, which temporarily raises exhaust temperatures). If you drive short urban cycles exclusively and never allow the engine to reach full operating temperature, the DPF will become blocked. Signs include: power reduction, increased fuel consumption, the DPF warning light. The fix is a 30–40 minute motorway run at 2,500+ rpm, which usually clears it. If it is left too long, forced regeneration at a dealership or DPF replacement (expensive) becomes necessary.

**Practical rule:** At least once every two weeks, take the car on a 30-minute motorway run. This is a diesel ownership requirement, not a Kia-specific issue.

## The 6-Speed Torque Converter Automatic

The AT6 is one of the better arguments for choosing this variant over the 136 hp DCT version.

**In Normal mode:** Smooth, relaxed, early upshifts to keep revs low and fuel consumption in check. Ideal for urban cruising. Sometimes frustratingly lazy when you want to accelerate quickly.

**In Sport mode:** Holds gears longer, responds to throttle input more eagerly, blips on downshifts. Transforms the driving experience meaningfully. Fuel consumption rises by roughly 1–1.5 L/100 km versus Normal mode in equivalent conditions.

**Manual mode (paddle shifters):** Works, but the gearbox will override your selection if it determines you are over-revving or lugging. Not a criticism — this protects the drivetrain.

**Weaknesses:** At very low speeds (parking manoeuvres, crawling in traffic) the torque converter occasionally hunts between first and second gear. It is not severe, but it is there. Keeping a light foot resolves it.

## Ride, Handling, and Real-World Dynamics

The Sportage is not a sports car. It should not be evaluated as one. What it is: a family SUV with a comfortable, slightly firm ride tuned for European roads.

**Ride quality:** The 19" wheels and their lower-profile tyres (235/45 R19 in the standard fitment) transmit more road imperfections than the 17" setup would. On smooth motorways it is excellent. On Romanian county roads with their patched surfaces and occasional crater, you feel it. Not harshly — but you feel it.

**Steering:** Electric power-assisted, well-weighted, communicates enough for a car of this type. It is not sporty but it is accurate. Motorway lane-keeping is effortless.

**Body roll:** Present, because this is a 166 cm tall SUV. Managed reasonably well by the suspension tuning. Cornering at pace requires respect for the vehicle's mass and height.

**AWD in winter:** This is where the HTRAC system earns its keep. On snow-covered or icy roads the car is noticeably more stable than front-wheel-drive alternatives of similar weight. It does not make you invincible — it makes you predictable. A critical distinction.

## Reliability and Ownership Costs

This is the section most buyers want and most reviewers skip.

**What has been reliable:** The engine itself has been solid. No unexpected faults, no oil consumption beyond what the service schedule specifies, no injector issues. The AT6 gearbox has been similarly trouble-free.

**What requires attention:**

- **Service intervals:** Kia specifies 15,000 km or 12 months for oil changes. With city-heavy driving and DPF cycles, consider 10,000 km intervals — diesel particulates contaminate the oil more rapidly in short-cycle driving.
- **Brake dust accumulation:** The 19" alloys with their open-spoke design show brake dust constantly. Cosmetic issue only, but worth noting if you care about appearance.
- **Infotainment system:** The 2018 head unit (7-inch touchscreen in base GT-Line, 8-inch in some markets) works but shows its age. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay work reliably. The native navigation is outdated. The interface is slow by 2026 standards.
- **Minor rattles:** After several years and significant mileage, a few interior trim rattles develop — common across the class. The A-pillar and dashboard-to-windscreen join are typical culprits.

**Approximate annual ownership costs (Romanian market, Cluj context):**

| Item | Approximate annual cost |
|---|---|
| Fuel (city-heavy, ~15,000 km/year) | RON 9,000–12,000 |
| Service (oil, filters) | RON 1,200–1,800 |
| Insurance (full casco + RCA) | RON 3,500–5,000 |
| Road tax (RAR) | RON 300–500 |
| Tyres (amortised over 4 years) | RON 1,000–1,500 |
| **Total estimate** | **RON 15,000–20,800/year** |

These are estimates. Your numbers will vary depending on mileage, driving style, insurance history, and whether you use a Kia dealership or an independent specialist.

## GT-Line vs. Reality: The Honest Assessment

The GT-Line packaging creates an expectation the car cannot fully meet. The body kit and sport seats look great in a car park. But at speed on a motorway, the Sportage feels exactly like its lesser-trimmed siblings — because it is. The suspension is not sportier. The steering is not sharper. The engine and gearbox are identical.

This is not a complaint — it is a calibration. If you want a comfortable, well-built, long-range diesel SUV with genuine AWD, a smooth automatic, and a 5-year/150,000 km warranty (as sold new), the Sportage GT-Line 2.0 CRDi 185 hp is an excellent choice. If you want something that drives like a sport utility vehicle rather than merely looking like one, look elsewhere.

---

## Verdict

**Buy it if:**
- You do a mix of city and motorway driving
- You want reliable AWD without Land Rover running costs
- Smooth automatic gearbox matters to you
- Diesel makes sense for your annual mileage (above 15,000 km/year)

**Think twice if:**
- You drive short urban cycles exclusively (DPF management becomes a chore)
- You want 6.1 L/100 km in real-world city conditions (you will not get it)
- You expect GT-Line to mean sport-tuned dynamics (it does not)

The 2018 Kia Sportage GT-Line 2.0 CRDi 185 AWD AT6 is a well-engineered, durable, honest machine. It does what it says on the tin — competently, quietly, and without drama. That is more than can be said for many of its competitors.
